# imt-344-cv-labs

This repository contains the group labs for the IMT-344 class. Each lab has its own directory.

## Lab 01

For Lab 01's second exercise, two solutions were developed. One of the solutions can be viewed by checking out the `bruno` branch. 

## Lab 02

For Lab 02, the students were required to form groups of up to three people and build a feature-based classifier for images of traffic lights. The objective of the lab was to classify the images into three classes based on the color of the light: `red`, `yellow`, or `green`. 

The lab involved several steps, including loading and visualizing the data, pre-processing the images, extracting features from the images, classifying the images using the features, visualizing the classification errors, and evaluating the model. The lab was started on March 28th, 2023, and the deadline for submission was April 8th, 2023, at 11:59 pm. 

The lab group consisted of four students: Leonardo Ach√° Boiano, Bruno Ramiro Rejas Montero, Matias Adorno Mazoccato, and Adrian Carhuaz. 

## Lab 03

For Lab 03, the students explored the differences between classification and object detection in an image. The lab involved two exercises.

In the first exercise, the students focused on classification and detection tasks, and the necessary steps to accomplish them. The lab emphasized that classification involves assigning a label or category to an entire image, while object detection focuses on finding and locating specific objects within an image. The lab highlighted that object detection involves location search, image patch classification, scaling and rotation adjustment, and eliminating redundant bounding boxes through Non-Maximum Suppression. The lab group obtained successful experimental results in pedestrian detection in an image using support vector machines and hog descriptors, with precise and efficient object detection.

In the second exercise, the students applied face and smile detection to create a facial retouching application using OpenCV's cascade-based face and smile detectors. The lab group conducted tests to recognize faces and smiles at different scales and with different numbers of neighbors. The minNeighbors parameter controlled the sensitivity of the detection algorithm and affected the algorithm's freedom to designate a mouth as a smile, while scaleFactor compensated for the size of objects in the image. Additionally, the lab group applied wrinkle filtering by filtering the saturation and value channels of the HSV color space of facial areas in images. In conclusion, face and smile detection, in combination with wrinkle filtering, is a robust and useful technique for creating facial retouching applications.

Overall, Lab 03 allowed the students to deepen their understanding of the differences between classification and object detection in an image and apply these concepts to real-world scenarios, such as pedestrian detection and facial retouching.
