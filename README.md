# imt-344-cv-labs

This repository contains the group labs for the IMT-344 class. Each lab has its own directory.

## Lab 01

For Lab 01's second exercise, two solutions were developed. One of the solutions can be viewed by checking out the `bruno` branch. 

## Lab 02

For Lab 02, the students were required to form groups of up to three people and build a feature-based classifier for images of traffic lights. The objective of the lab was to classify the images into three classes based on the color of the light: `red`, `yellow`, or `green`. 

The lab involved several steps, including loading and visualizing the data, pre-processing the images, extracting features from the images, classifying the images using the features, visualizing the classification errors, and evaluating the model. The lab was started on March 28th, 2023, and the deadline for submission was April 8th, 2023, at 11:59 pm. 

The lab group consisted of four students: Leonardo Ach√° Boiano, Bruno Ramiro Rejas Montero, Matias Adorno Mazoccato, and Adrian Carhuaz.
